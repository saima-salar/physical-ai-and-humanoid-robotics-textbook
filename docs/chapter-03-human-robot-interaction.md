# Chapter 03: Human-Robot Interaction

## Introduction

Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is a multidisciplinary field that focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of robots for use by or with humans. For humanoid robots, HRI is particularly important as these robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact naturally with people. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations, design principles, and practical considerations for creating effective and safe human-robot interactions.

## Foundations of Human-Robot Interaction

### Historical Context

The field of HRI has evolved significantly since the early days of industrial robotics:

- **First Wave (1950s-1980s)**: Focus on industrial robots operating in isolated environments
- **Second Wave (1990s-2000s)**: Introduction of collaborative robots and initial HRI research
- **Third Wave (2000s-present)**: Development of social robots and advanced interaction paradigms

### Theoretical Frameworks

Several theoretical frameworks guide HRI research and design:

- **Social Response Theory**: Humans respond to computers and robots as social actors
- **Media Equation**: People treat computers as real social actors
- **Social Presence Theory**: The degree to which a robot is perceived as a real social actor
- **Uncanny Valley Hypothesis**: The relationship between robot appearance and human comfort

## Communication Modalities
